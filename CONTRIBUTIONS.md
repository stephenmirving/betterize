<[@metric_dev](https://twitter.com/metric_dev)>.

- Be friendly and patient: Remember you might not be communicating in someone
  else’s primary spoken or programming language, and others may not have your
  level of understanding.
- Be welcoming: Our communities welcome and support people of all backgrounds
  and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race,
  ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and
  economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity
  and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and
  mental and physical ability.
- Be respectful: We are a world-wide community of professionals, and we conduct
  ourselves professionally. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor
  manners. Disrespectful and unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:
  - Violent threats or language.
  - Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language.
  - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  - Posting, or threatening to post, people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).
  - Insults, especially those using discriminatory terms or slurs.
  - Behavior that could be perceived as sexual attention.
  - Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.
- Understand disagreements: Disagreements, both social and technical, are useful
  learning opportunities. Seek to understand the other viewpoints and resolve
  differences constructively.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to capture our common
understanding of a productive, collaborative environment. The code should
followed in spirit as much as in the letter.

**Basically:** Just be _KIND_, _COOL_, &amp; _CHILL_!

There is literally zero reason for you to be behave in any other manner while
contributing to open source.
