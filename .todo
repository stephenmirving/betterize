TODO:
  ☐ Make available for installation with NPM and Yarn
  ☐ Do further testing for anything that can be removed or changed
  ☐ Split Betterize into 2 main versions
    ☐ The current version that tries to support all legacy browsers (rename `betterize-all`)
    ☐ A slimmed down version that does not attempt to support IE
