# betterize

_betterize_ is a more modern and opinionated CSS normalization file for
better cross-browser design and default styling in 2024.

Versions in CSS, SASS, SCSS, and LESS are available.

## Betterize is still in active testing for what can be optimized, added, or removed

**This is *betterize* version 0.9.9 - Last update: 01/03/24

## Deployment

To use *betterize*, simply download the repo and choose which version of the file
you will use from the style folder. This depends on which CSS preprocessor you
are using, or if you are using one at all. Of course, you can also simply copy
and paste from the file.

The next update (ver. 1.0.0) will allow for installing directly into your
project via NPM.
