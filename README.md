# betterize

_betterize_ is a more modern and opinionated CSS normalization file for
better cross-browser design and default styling in 2024.

Instead of CSS resets that will overwrite all the user-agent styles and require you
to add much of what was taken away back in yourself, CSS normalization seeks to 
make your markup render consistently across browsers while maintaining modern standards.

With [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) remaining the same for more than 6 years now, I began adding my own
defaults that take advantage of modern CSS and removing old fixes that are no longer necessary.

## Versions in .css, .min.css, .sass, .scss, .less are available.

**This is *betterize* version 0.9.9 - Last update: 01/03/24**

**Betterize is still in active testing for what can be optimized, added, or removed**

### Deployment

To use *betterize*, simply download the repo and choose which version of the file
you will use from the style folder. This depends on which CSS preprocessor you
are using, or if you are using one at all. Of course, you can also simply copy
and paste from the file.

The next update (ver. 1.0.0) will allow for installing directly into your
project via NPM.
